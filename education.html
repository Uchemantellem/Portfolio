		<div class="parallaxedu"></div>
		<p id="edu-p">
		I received my Bachelors degree in Computer Science Engineering.  This crosses one of my milestones off the list! I am currently pursing a Masters in Science Information degree at the University of Michigan.

		<h2 id="second-words">Inspiration</h2>
		<p>My motivation to be an engineer started when I was in middle school. Ever since I was young, I have been constantly viewing the world in the way of an engineer. For example, whenever friends and families have computer issues, I am usually the one to troubleshoot the issue and repair it. Due to this, it fostered my curiosity towards technology and has evolved as I became more educated. Specifically, when I visit my family in Nigeria every year, I would always think about ways to improve the infrastructure and function of technological systems to better the overall livelihood in the country. Focusing on Human Computer Interaction as my technical area, I would gain a deeper understanding on how to conquer this problem. People of Nigeria could greatly benefit from tools that would simplify and increase their ability to integrate computers into their society.</p>
