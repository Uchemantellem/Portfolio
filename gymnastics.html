		<h2>Inspiration</h2>
		<div class="parallaxgym"></div>
		<p>Participating in the sport of Men's Gymnastics brought along many difficulties. Advancing through middle school and high school I have been given many different remarks because of the way the sport is looked upon.  Rumors spread that it is a feministic sport, in which impacted me, making me not want to follow through with it.  Getting an acceptance to the University of Michigan has proved all of the people who tried to make fun of me wrong.  I will always remember how people looked at me, and am motivated to show them that my gymnastics, will partake greatly in my success in the future.
		</p>
		<h2>Balance</h2>
		<p>As a student athlete, I had to learn how to balance school and gymnastics. Ever since I was a child, I excelled in classes and built social relationships while spending 30 hours every week in the gym. My efforts in school and gymnastics have given me the opportunity to compete in an international competition in South Africa as a step to become the first Nigerian Olympic gymnast. Athletics has not only taught me how to handle intense high-pressure situations, it has also taught me how to be a team player while maintaining an arduous schedule. My time management skills have vastly improved by balancing rigorous academics with gymnastics. Having the experience of taking an exam at the NCAA Finals gymnastics competition proved to me that I am ready to handle my future endeavors. For example, this year I had to undergo a shoulder surgery which caused me to forfeit my athletic eligibility. Due to this I had to balancegoing to physical therapy, doctor appointments, and practice to support my teammates on top ofmaking school deadlines.</p>
